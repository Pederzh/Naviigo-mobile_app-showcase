# Naviigo

Naviigo is the Airbnb for hourly boat rentals.

Naviigo is a transactional two-sided platform that connects tourists directly not only with businesses that offer boat rentals but also with private boat owners who can rent their own boat and earn money.
Tourists set the location, date, their preferences, choose the available boat, and book. 
While boat owners can add a boat in 5 steps, 30 seconds each, and wait for the first booking to come.
